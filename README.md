# File New: Build a Serverless Microservices from Scratch

## Abstract
The microservice pattern serves as an excellent practice in building modern applications to be more resilient and reduce dependencies across multiple components of a system.  Often these solutions are based on complex web frameworks and containerization.  Using Azure Functions, we can develop more concise services even quicker and get many additional benefits that come with serverless technology without all the operational management.  In this session, we will focus on the how by starting with an empty Visual Studio solution and building a complete serverless microservice solution using Azure Functions that solve a real-world problem.  You will see firsthand how to design, develop, and deploy the Azure Function App providing services usable to perform valuable services.

## Short Abstract
Starting with an empty Visual Studio solution, during this session we will build a serverless microservice to solve a real-world problem.
